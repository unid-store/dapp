Super simple and quick file sharing, but decentralized.

Super simple file sharing - a well known issue, people shared files even before the internet, trough BBS.

Just google "Simple file sharing" and you'll findstons of web2 services, however you it's really hard to do through Filecoin infrastracture. 

Our goal is to launch such a simple file exchange service build on top of Filecoin, that would allow to share file in a few click, so people even won't notice they are using web3 solutions.
